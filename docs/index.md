    Still.js is a modern frontend framework that enables developers to write and reuse Vanilla JavaScript while providing a modular and component-based architecture similar to React, Angular, and VueJS. It offers a lightweight yet powerful approach to structuring applications, allowing for better maintainability and scalability without introducing a complex abstraction layer. With StillJS, you get the flexibility of raw JavaScript while benefiting from an organized and efficient development workflow.
    <p>
    A limitted set of resources a features are provided by still.js, yet those resources offer a complete and transversall capabilities for building Web Applications frontend from the very simple ones, to the most complex ones, follo the list of features in summary:

    <div class="st-fw-feature-highlighting-ok">
        <span class="feat">Component Base UI</span>,
        <span class="feat">HTML Base template</span>,
        <span class="feat">Built-in notations/directives</span>,
        <span class="feat">User permission flow</span>,

    </div>

### Microfrontend Disruptivelly
One particular aspect of Still.js is the capabilities it provides to create microfronted in a disruptive way, means, we can embed Still.js component in our existing application, but, such component can be a whole front end providing access to all kind of features including navigation.


### Annotation Based
Still.js is built entirely on vanilla JavaScript, no builder or bundler are used. It introduces a unique approach to annotations by leveraging JSDoc and JavaScript comments, not for documentation but to dynamically add features at runtime.


### Typing
Still.js uses JSDoc for typing and type hinting, enabling most TypeScript features. However, typing is generally optional, except in specific cases where it's required.
